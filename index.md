Description
Flowering time involves the transition from vegetative growth to the flowering state and it refers to the number of days from sowing to the appearance of the first fully opened flower. Flowering time is the major domestication trait defining the adaptation of chickpea to different agro-climatic conditions, and therefore is a major determinant of its productivity. Despite early flowering time being suggested as a means to increase chickpea adaptability roughly 45 years ago , studies on the genetic control of flowering time have appeared only within the 21st century. Although classical genetic analyses have provided a wealth of valuable information, the molecular identities of genes underlying the major flowering time locus remains mostly elusive.
